# Polarized Light and Optical Systems

This repository reproduces some of the plots generated in Polarized Light and Optical Systems (CRC Press).  I started doing this because I enjoyed the book and regenerating some of the plots was a way to force me to read the text a bit more carefully than I usually do.

Anyway, I put some of my work up here in case it is of use to anyone else.  For a few of the chapters I heavily leaned on the tftb toolbox documented here:  https://github.com/ulfgri/tftb-toolbox/tree/master
